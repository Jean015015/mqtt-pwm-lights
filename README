SUMMARY
=======

This script subscribes to a topic defined in /etc/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.cfg, and adjust the PWM value on the configured pin (18 by defualt) on a Raspberry Pi. It requires the WiringPi library from https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/ as the gpio command is used to control the PWM values on the GPIO interface. Neither WiringPi SYSFS exporting or RPi.GPIO (Python library) support PWM at this point in time.

When any change to the lighting level is required, it will ramp up or down to the desired level, creating a smooth lighting level change effect.

INSTALL
=======

sudo apt-get install python-mosquitto git
mkdir /etc/mqtt-pwm-lights/
git clone git://github.com/kylegordon/mqtt-pwm-lights.git /usr/local/mqtt-pwm-lights/
cp /usr/local/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.cfg.example /etc/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.cfg
cp /usr/local/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.init /etc/init.d/mqtt-pwm-lights
update-rc.d mqtt-pwm-lights defaults
cp /usr/local/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.default /etc/default/mqtt-pwm-lights
## Edit /etc/default/mqtt-pwm-lights and /etc/mqtt-pwm-lights/mqtt-pwm-lights.cfg to suit
